This project is structured to help you build essential R skills while working with real-world  data.

# **Clinical R Programming**

Before diving into Clinical Reporting in R, we first provide solutions to basic and advanced data manipulation exercises, along with ggplot2 graphs and interactive 
plots. Try to solve the exercises yourself first! Practice ! Click the button 
<tt>Show</tt> for the solution.

The second project is a Shift Table. With both basic and advanced data 
manipulation techniques, this should be easy to follow through. Familiarity with creation of custom functions is encouraged- better than copy and paste!

The third project is a Progression Free Survival (PFS) table. Here, a high-level
understanding of Survival analysis is a requirement!

1. Data Manipulation & Visualization
- Tidyverse & dplyr for efficient data wrangling
- Custom function creation for reusability
